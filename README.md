# CGT515_Final

For my final project for the CGT-515 class, Virtual Enviroments, I developed a data visualization application to demonstrate different data  presentations tools for the spread of COVID-19 in the US.
I will link below the where I got the data from, but most of the data is current except for the animation and 3D graph where I could only use the data from March 8th till April 5th. So I had about 3 different visualization tools: the 3D graph showing the timeline of spread of COVID-19 as well as the death rate increase, the US map with different information from each state and an animation, and a grid of blocks that shows the percentage of infected or tested per each state. Each tool has a menu so the user can select to see different data representations in different ways. The user can also click in the points or columns to get each data per state. Mostly what I learned from this data is that currently the number of infected is not that big per state given the measures we took with the lockdown. The number of deaths is also not as high. However, testing is low especially in states like the midwest and southwest. The number of people not recovered yet also is a quite high which increases the risk of spreading the disease further and needs more resources and care from medical facilities. Still in most cases, recovery will be possible although it will take some time. Now since testing is low and some people donâ€™t show symptoms but still can spread the disease around, the numbers of infected in the data might actually be much higher.

Some minimal data analysis was done by me as well. This project was developed with the idea that in the future, it would become a VR application, however due to current circumstances, I do not have a VR headset to make that possible.
