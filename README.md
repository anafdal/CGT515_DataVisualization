# CGT515_Finale

For my final project for the CGT-515 class, Virtual Enviroments, I developed a data visualization application to demonstrate different data  presentations for the spread of COVID-19 in the US.
I developed a 3D graph for the timleine of COVID-19 in each state, as well as a map visualization for each state that presents information like how many infected there are in each state, how many were tested, how many recovered etc.
The data was gathered from and some minimal data analysis was done by me:

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/
https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-state-total.html

This project was developed with the idea that in the future, it would become a VR application, however due to current circumstances, I do not have enough resorces to make that possible.
